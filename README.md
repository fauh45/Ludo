## Game Design
### Player
User can chose from 1 to 3 computer player.  There's only one human player in the game.

### Ludo Board

### Game Rules
At the start of the game each of the players token is positioned in their respective corners, the system chooses the first player. The second, third, and fourth are automatically chosen based on their position on the board itself.

Each player rolls a dice, and when the dice show 6 the player can move out one of their token. After the dice shows 6, the player can rolls a dice again, and if the dice shows 6 again, the player have a choice of moving the token or move out another token. If the second roll of dice shows 6, the third roll of dice whatever the number is, the player can only move one of their token. If all of their token are out of their respective corners, the player **cannot** take other players token. After the third roll of the dice, the game moves to the next player.

The movement of the tokens follows the pattern showed on the picture of Ludo board.

There can only be one token in a point in the board. If a player move to a point in the board, and there's other token in the point other than the players token, the token that's already in the point get kicked out to the starting position. If the token is near the home base (the last place to move) the number of move need to be exactly the same or lower as the number shown at the dice, otherwise the game moves to next player.

### Game Over
The game is over after few terms :

 1. The human player has won in first place
 2. or if three of the computer player has won

## Compile Guide
The game uses PDCurses as the library to graphic functions. So you'll have to make PDCurses according to your system.

Usage of ncurses might work as syntax in PDCurses looks the same, but it's **untested**.

To compile the game using gcc, use this command :

    gcc Ludo.c path_to_PDCurses_libray
